## Learning Objectives:bulb:
What you should learn from this project:

Figma will be your friend!

During these projects, you won’t have a lot of instruction, you are free to implement it the way that you want - the objective is simple: Have a fully functional web pages that look the same as the [designer file](https://intranet-projects-files.s3.amazonaws.com/holbertonschool-webstack/622/Archive.zip).

It’s not an easy exercise, but it will be your life in company/start-up, you will discuss with designers, implement their work and make them review your implementation.

Building a web page the right way, is not easy - expect if you put in place strong foundations:

* reset CSS styling
* use variables
* simple/“as generic as you can” CSS selectors
* avoid as more as you can super specific CSS selector
* simple HTML structure - div containers are your friend!

Last advice: I always start to build a web page from outside to inside and from top to bottom.

Now, your turn!

## Tasks

### 0. Read and be familiar with Figma
Create an account in Figma and open this project and “Duplicate to your Drafts” to have access to all design details.
Important notes with Figma:

*If your computer doesn’t have missing fonts, you can find them here: [source-sans-pro](https://intranet.hbtn.io/rltoken/wltHny-KZP3B8JFRvpmVjA) and [Spin-Cycle-OT](https://intranet.hbtn.io/rltoken/Qb96K4nTPQJO1paP_OBELw)
*some values are in float - feel free to round them

For this task, please write an amazing README.md

Interactions note:

* the web page must switch to the mobile version when the screen width is 480px or less
* links hover/active: #FF6565
* button hover/active: opacity: 0.9
* max width of the content: 1000px centered in the page

### 1. Header
Building a web page the right way, is not easy - expect if you put in place strong foundations:

* reset CSS styling
* use variables
* simple/“as generic as you can” CSS selectors
* avoid as more as you can super specific CSS selector
* simple HTML structure - div containers are your friend!

Last advice: Personally, I always start to build a web page from outside to inside and from top to bottom. But you can try to other way - it’s fine - but you should structure the way that you will implement a component and not get lost with HTML tags.

Now, your turn!

For this first task: create the header/hero piece

Here an archive of all assets needed: [images_0x09.zip](https://holbertonintranet.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/misc/2020/3/d1597894d79386c83b9b.zip?X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&X-Amz-Credential=AKIARDDGGGOUWMNL5ANN%2F20210526%2Fus-east-1%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&X-Amz-Date=20210526T155807Z&X-Amz-Expires=345600&X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&X-Amz-Signature=5ac6dfb6ff775e22bf3e61afedc63b09d05568e1f1d7964974eaf4fc851c6af6)

Repo:

GitHub repository: holberton-headphones
File: 0-index.html, 0-styles.css

--------------
### 2. "What we do..." section
Copy files from the previous task.

For this second task: create the “What we do…” section

In this section, you will need custom font icons. Here the archive of it: [holberton_school-icon.zip](https://holbertonintranet.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/misc/2020/3/7159d988278de54d859d.zip?X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&X-Amz-Credential=AKIARDDGGGOUWMNL5ANN%2F20210526%2Fus-east-1%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&X-Amz-Date=20210526T155807Z&X-Amz-Expires=345600&X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&X-Amz-Signature=88d3fc0ef7ae39f96dc2f178fc42026ad0841ce1ac96ae976fc7aa0539c7b5e6) Inside you will find demo page of how to use it.

Important: try to build as generic as you can… you will probably need some components in next section.

Repo:

GitHub repository: holberton-headphones
File: 1-index.html, 1-styles.css

------------
### 3. "Our results" section

Copy files from the previous task.
For this third task: create the “Our results” section
Now you can reuse components form the previous task!

Repo:

GitHub repository: holberton-headphones
File: 2-index.html, 2-styles.css

------------
### 4. Contact us

Copy files from the previous task.
A good landing page has always a contact form.
You are free to add any animations and/or constraints on fields.

Repo:

GitHub repository: holberton-headphones
File: 3-index.html, 3-styles.css

------------
### 5. Footer

Copy files from the previous task.
Last piece of the page… the Footer!

Repo:

GitHub repository: holberton-headphones
File: 4-index.html, 4-styles.css

------------
### 6. Replace background image with... code!

In the section “Our results”; without the use of an image file, draw each pentagon using HTML and CSS.

Repo:

GitHub repository: holberton-headphones
File: 100-index.html, 100-styles.css

------------
### 7. Let's animate items

From 4-index.html and 4-styles.css, add fun animations to “What we do…” and “Our results” sections items row. Either all the time, either when hover.

Scaling, opacity, rotation, bouncing… many options!

Repo:

GitHub repository: holberton-headphones
File: 101-index.html, 101-styles.css

------------
### 8. And SASS??

Take your 101-styles.css file and create a 102-styles.scss that will be the SASS version of it.

$ sass 102-styles.scss > 101-styles.css
Repo:

GitHub repository: holberton-headphones
File: 102-styles.scss
